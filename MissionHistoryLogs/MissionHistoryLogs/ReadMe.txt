Have you ever wanted to see your performance over time while playing XCOM 2? Well now you can!
This mod shows different details about the mission as well as information surrounding the mission.

If you don't have the TLE, here is a WOTC version [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928378285] click here [/url]


The squad manager is not a hard dependency. If it doesn't detect the squad manager, it uses "XCOM" as the name for the squad in the table.
Thanks to Rusty's Suggestion,
you can go into the MissionHistoryLogs.int file and change what you want the default to be.

If you have LWOTC Installed, you do not need the squad manager, as the squad manager mod is a baked in component of LWOTC and creates issues when both are active.

If you install mid campaign, do not attempt to access the page until you have completed a mission, otherwise it will Crash to Desktop (CTD)

There is a small bug with LWOTC where text will display that is meant for VIP missions. Currently investigating that

You can also thank Rusty for the CTD fix on Ongoing campaigns.

Leave a comment if you want me to add something and I'll see what I can do.
