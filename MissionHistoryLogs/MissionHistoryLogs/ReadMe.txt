Have you ever wanted to see your performance over time while playing XCOM 2? Well now you can!
This mod shows different details about the mission as well as information surrounding the mission.


This version requires the Tactical Legacy Pack but I will create one for WOTC and link it here later in the future.

The squad manager is not a hard dependency. If it doesn't detect the squad manager, it uses "XCOM" as the name for the squad in the table.

Leave a comment if you want me to add something and I'll see what I can do.
